            <p>She tried to think of something to do, but
                it was a hot day and she felt very sleepy
                and stupid. She was still sitting and thinking
                when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran past her.
                It was a very strange hole. Alice was falling very slowly, and she had time to think and to look around
                her. She could see nothing below her because it was so dark. But when she looked at the sides of the
                hole, she could see cupboards and books and pictures on the walls. She had time to take things out of a
                cupboard, look at them, and then put them back in a cupboard lower down.</p>
